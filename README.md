# Project Overview  

This project is an Excel-based data analysis for Market Cart, a fictional retail company. It focuses on organizing and analyzing sales data to identify key patterns and insights that can support better decision-making. The company struggled with raw, unstructured data that made it difficult to track sales and profit trends over time. As a data analyst, I developed a solution that cleans, structures, and visualizes the data, enabling performance analysis by product category, customer, and region. The project also provides interactive filtering by year, month, and category, delivering actionable insights through clear and dynamic visualizations.

# Objectives

The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic Excel dashboard for *Market Cart*, with the following goals:

- Track sales and profit over multiple years to monitor long-term business performance.  
- Analyze performance by product category, customer segment, and region to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.  
- Provide interactive filtering by year, month, and category for flexible and user-friendly data exploration.  
- Deliver actionable insights through clear and intuitive visualizations that support strategic planning and data-driven decision-making.

The data preparation stage focused on consolidating and refining raw datasets to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for analysis:  

- **Combined datasets** by integrating sales records, customer information, and product category data into a single structured model.  
- **Cleaned and standardized entries** to address missing values, remove inconsistencies, and unify formats across all data sources.  
- **Created calculated fields** such as total profit, customer count, and derived metrics to enable deeper performance analysis.

These insights provide actionable guidance for strategic decision-making, such as focusing on high-demand products, strengthening operations in top-performing regions, and nurturing relationships with key customers.  

## Business Recommendations  

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can help *Market Cart* strengthen performance and drive sustainable growth:  

- **Capitalize on Technology and Top-Selling Categories:**  
  Continue investing in high-demand products such as Phones and Chairs by expanding inventory, negotiating better supplier terms, and running targeted marketing campaigns.  

- **Leverage Seasonal Demand Peaks:**  
  Increase marketing and promotional efforts ahead of November and December to maximize revenue during the holiday season. Consider bundling products or offering limited-time discounts to boost sales further.  

- **Strengthen Regional Focus:**  
  Allocate more resources to high-performing regions like New York and California, including localized promotions, partnerships, and improved logistics to sustain competitive advantage.  

- **Nurture High-Value Customers:**
